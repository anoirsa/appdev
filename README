1 - Configuration Instructions :  
In order to run this project .First you need to have some esseintial devices in which this application were built on
The necessarily devices are :
1)-Raspberry pi
2)-SD CARD
3)-External USB sound card
4)-Microphone .


Also other important condition for this project is that it has to be run through a Linux system . it cannot be be executed through any other operating system.
   

2 - Installation instructions : 

There are several settings that need to be applied to the devices before starting using the application . Otherwise the application may not run sucessfully

1) -  Setting the USB Sound Card as Default : 
In order to so  you need to : 
* boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card. Use .lsusb. command to check if your USB sound card is mounted
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0d8c:000c C-Media Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMSC9512/9514 Fast Ethernet Adapter
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9514 Standard Microsystems Corp.
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
* Use .sudo nano /etc/asound.conf.command and put following content to the file:
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:1,0"
  }
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}

*  Go to your home directory. Use .nano .asoundrc. command and put the same content to the file.

*  Run .alsamixer. you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device. For a more sensitive sound detection, it is better to maximize the volume of .Mic..

1) - Fix the Bug of arecord : 
In order to do so. Please do the following steps : 
* Use .sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list. command and add the last line: 
deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
# Uncomment line below then 'apt-get update' to enable 'apt-get source'
#deb-src http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi

* Run .sudo apt-get update.

* Run .sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils. to check if version 1.0.25 of alsa-util is available:
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils
Package alsa-utils:
i   1.0.25-4                                    oldstable                                 500
p   1.0.28-1                                    stable                                    500

* Run .sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4. to downgrade.

* Reboot (if necessary)

* Run .arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav. to test that your microphone is working. You should see a .test.wav. file in the current folder.

* Put earphone on the USB sound card. Run .aplay test.wav. to check that your recording is okay.


3 - Operating Instructions

You first have to build the file by commanding  : "make clean" and then "make".
After the first step you need to run the application by commanding /sound.out . The microphone will start recording the sound within its the enviromnment, you could easily access the recorded results on the screen.
If you want to make a frequency sound file of the recorded results you could easily do by commanding /sound.out arg 
The results are also sent to PHP server.
